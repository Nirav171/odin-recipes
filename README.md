# Odin Recipes

This is my first project from **The Odin Project**.  
It is a simple recipe website built using **HTML**.

## Skills Demonstrated
- Creating and structuring an HTML document
- Using headings, paragraphs, links, and images
- Organizing multiple HTML files in a project
- Practicing version control with Git and GitHub

## Reflection
Once completed, I will have demonstrated the ability to set up a project from scratch, track it with Git, and push it to a remote repository on GitHub.
